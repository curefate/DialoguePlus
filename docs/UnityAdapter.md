# DialoguePlus Unity Adapter

The **DialoguePlus Unity Adapter** bridges the D+ core with Unity’s scene lifecycle and game objects. It provides:

- A lightweight, persistent **singleton** to access default D+ compiler, executer and runtime.
- One‑shot compile‑and‑run convenience API
- Automatic function registration via attributes for both static and instance methods

## Quick Start

- TODO, recommended to refer to the example scene included in the package, you can import it from PackageManager of Unity.
